## Useful Notes

- Mac EFI Toolkit creates its own directories within the working directory to extract and store files. The application is designed to be self-contained, ensuring that all necessary files and data are managed within the application's working environment.
- The Startup, EFIROM, and SOCROM windows all support drag-and-drop functionality. However, when running the application as an administrator, this feature will be disabled due to Windows security mechanisms and the way it handles file access. There is generally no need to run the application as an administrator.
- The EFIROM and SOCROM windows display application memory usage in the title bar, and this data will refresh every four seconds. This feature does not work under Wine, as the GetProcessMemoryInfo() API call is only implemented as a stub method in the Wine compatibility layer.
- In the event of an unhandled exception, the application will automatically capture the error and generate a log file in the working directory. This log can be uploaded to GitHub issues if needed for troubleshooting.
- In the EFIROM window, the '@' icon in the status bar becomes clickable when an email address is detected within the firmware. Clicking the icon will display the detected email address.

## Serial Number Patching

Both the EFIROM and SOCROM windows follow the same procedure for serial number patching.

1. From the main menu, select `Patch > Change Serial Number`. A prompt will appear, asking for the new system serial number. Enter the new serial number and click `OKAY` to proceed.

</kbd>

2. After confirming the new serial number, the prompt will close. The application will update the Fsys region with the new serial data and automatically correct the CRC32 checksum. Once the process is complete, a save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the modified firmware binary.

## Erase NVRAM (EFI)

1. From the main menu, select `Patch > Erase NVRAM`. A prompt will appear, allowing you to choose the desired NVRAM regions (VSS, SVS). Select the regions to be erased and click `OKAY` to proceed.

<kbd>
  <img src="stream/images/manual/nvram.png">
</kbd>

2. Once the selected regions are confirmed, the prompt will close. The application will initialize the NVRAM store headers, clear the data (set to 0xFF), and confirm the stores were erased successfully. After completion, a save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the modified firmware binary.

## Replace Fsys Store (EFI)

**Note:** The application can extract the Fsys Store region from any EFI firmware (when available). To do this, open the desired firmware and, from the main menu, select `Export > Export Fsys Store`. A save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the 800h Fsys Block.

1. From the main menu, select `Patch > Replace Fsys Store`. An open file dialog will appear, allowing you to select the new Fsys Store region.

2. After selecting the new Fsys Store, the application will validate the file, automatically mask the checksum if needed, and write the new region into the firmware. Once the process is complete, a save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the modified firmware binary.

## Replace Intel ME Region (EFI)

**Note:** It is important for the user to ensure accurate replacement of the ME Region when utilizing the application. The application allows for the transfer of a dumped or configured region but does not provide a guarantee of accuracy. A repository of clean Apple firmware can be found here on [Github](https://github.com/gdbinit/firmware_vault). This repository provides a collection of clean Apple firmware files containing clean and configured ME regions that can be extracted using Mac EFI Toolkit. To do so, open the desired firmware and, from the main menu, select `Export > Export Intel ME Region`. A save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the Intel ME region.

For users who require a higher level of certainty and guidance in replacing the ME region, I recommend referring to resources such as the guide available on [Win-Raid](https://winraid.level1techs.com/t/guide-clean-dumped-intel-engine-cs-me-cs-txe-regions-with-data-initialization/31277) written by platomav, or this post on [Logi.wiki](https://logi.wiki/index.php/Clean_EFI_ME_Region). These resources provide comprehensive instructions and information on performing a clean replacement of the ME Region while ensuring accuracy.

1. From the main menu, select `Patch > Replace Intel ME Region`. An open file dialog will appear, allowing you to select the new ME region.

2. After selecting the new ME region, the application will validate the file, and write the new region into the firmware. Once the process is complete, a save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the modified firmware binary.

## Fix Fsys Checksum (EFI)

**Note:** This option is only available when an invalid Fsys CRC32 checksum is detected.

To fix the checksum, go to the main menu and select `Patch > Fix Fsys Checksum`. The application will automatically repair the Fsys checksum and verify that it has been written successfully. Once the process is complete, a save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the modified firmware binary.

## Invalidate EFI Lock (EFI)

**Note:** This option is only available when a Message Authentication Code (MAC) is detected in the SVS NVRAM.

To safely disable the EFI lock while retaining the Secure Variable Store (SVS), go to the main menu and select `Patch > Invalidate EFI Lock`. The application will invalidate the Message Authentication Code in each applicable store, write the updated data back to the firmware, and verify the changes were applied successfully. Once the process is complete, a save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the modified firmware binary.

## Write New SCfg Store (SOC)

**Note:** If no SCfg store is detected in the target firmware, the application will automatically assign a base address of `0x28A000h` for the new store. Before proceeding, the application will verify that this region in the target firmware is clear of data (0xFF). If the region is not empty, the write operation will be refused.

The application can extract the SCfg Store region from any SOC firmware (when available). To do this, open the desired firmware and, from the main menu, select `Export > Export SCfg Store`. A save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the store.

1. From the main menu, select `Patch > Write new SCfg Store`. An open file dialog will appear, allowing you to select the new store.

2. After selecting the new SCfg store, the application will validate the file, and write the new region into the firmware. Once the process is complete, a save dialog will appear, allowing you to export the modified firmware binary.
