## Version 2.1.2

### Enhancements
- User interface improvements.
- Minor string adjustments.
- Updated CREATED and MODIFIED timestamps to use a consistent, simplified format for improved readability.
- Updated the layout of the output text file when exporting SOCROM firmware information, specifically for cases where the SCfg store is not present.
- Included SHA-256 checksum in firmware information export data.
- Updated the internal database.
- Added fallback for missing HWC during Fsys parsing: now derived from the last 3â€“4 characters of the serial when unavailable in firmware. Helps address instances of missing config data.


### Bugs
- **Reworked firmware parser architecture:** Replaced the hotfix from version 2.1.1 with a permanent solution. Firmware parsing logic is now fully decoupled from form UI logic. Each window now operates on its own parser instance, preventing shared state issues when multiple windows are opened or closed. Support for using multiple firmware windows simultaneously has been restored.
- Fixed an issue in the Settings window where an empty path could be displayed if the folder selection dialog was cancelled. The UI now only updates when a valid path is selected.

## Version 2.1.1

### Hotfix
- Temporarily disabled opening multiple firmware windows to prevent shared state conflicts present since version 2.0.0. **Users still on older versions should avoid opening more than one EFIROM or SOCROM window at a time**, as doing so may result in incorrect values being written to firmware files. A permanent fix is in progress.

## Version 2.1.0

### New
- Introduced an updater to automatically download new application versions.

### Enhancements
- Improved formatting of the Order No. string in the SOCROM window.
- Updated the internal database.
- Added SoC controller type to the SOCROM window export information.

### Bugs
- Fixed memory usage displaying as 0 bytes on Windows by addressing memory mapping issues in PROCESS_MEMORY_COUNTERS.
- Fixed a bug where the SOCROM parser assumed all SCfg stores had a length of B8h, causing failed store writes when the data length differed.

## Version 2.0.4

### Enhancements
- Enabled support for opening Apple Silicon SOCROM firmware.
- Added SoC type to the SOCROM window iBoot version label.

### Bugs
- Older 2MB EFI files now open correctly instead of being incorrectly flagged as invalid.
- EFIROM window model text now correctly displays a comma when the string contains only two numeric digits at the end.
- Fixed an issue where the SOCROM iBoot version label displayed invalid data when the length byte was incorrect or corrupt.

### Misc
- Updated Segoe MDL2 font resource to version 1.86 for improved compatibility and appearance.

## Version 2.0.3

### Bugs
- Resolved an issue where pressing `Alt + F4` would incorrectly open the settings window before closing the application or active window as expected.
- Resolved an issue where certain APFS capable firmware incorrectly reported the driver as not found. This was caused by an oversight in LZMA header verification logic (thanks reformatt @ badcaps).

## Version 2.0.2

### Enhancements
- User interface improvements.
- Updated the internal database with more models.
- Improved reliability when detecting LZMA DXE archives.

## Version 1.1.0

#### New:
- Introduced a new option in the main window that allows users to remove EFI Lock without clearing the SVS NVRAM store (ALT + L). This method offers a safer approach as it retains the SVS NVRAM data whilst only invalidating the Message Authentication Code (Use of this feature will require acceptance of the editing terms).
- Added dialog when text is copied via the main window copy menu.

#### Enhancements:
- Improved the Fsys parser by implementing dynamic reading of the Fsys store size. This improvement replaces the previous static approach of reading a hardcoded size of 0x800h (2048 bytes).

- Removed setting "Enable valid flash descriptor enforcement" from the application, as it is no longer required or relevant.

## Version 1.0.3

#### New:
- Updated the firmware parser with a new feature that attempts to force find the Fsys Store if it was not initially located within the NVRAM on the first pass. This change makes the application more reliable at extracting Fsys data from corrupt firmware.

#### Enhancements:
- Implemented a visual colour change in the presentation of NVRAM store labels in the main window. The manual has been updated to reflect this change.
- Improved the image validation logic.
- User interface improvements.

#### Bugs:
- Fixed a scenario that caused a crash when dragging and dropping a file onto the application executable and subsequently clicking "Create a Debug Log." This issue was caused by a malformed file path in specific scenarios, and was resolved by dynamically constructing the executable file path when necessary.

## Version 1.0.2

#### Enhancements:
- Reverted the main buttons back to text-based buttons, restoring their original form without the use of icons.
- Other User Interface improvements.
