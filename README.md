## Introduction

**Mac EFI Toolkit** (also known as **mefit**) is designed to aid technicians in repair and analysis of Mac EFI and Intel based Mac SOCROM firmwares. Designed to be compact, this application provides information gathering capabilities and limited patching functionality.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System:**
  - Windows 11 (64-bit)
  - Windows 10 (32/64-bit)
  - **mefit** is compatible with [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/)

- **Internet Connectivity** (optional, only required for specific features):
  - Receiving notifications about new versions (can be disabled in settings).
  - Fetching device configuration data from Appleâ€™s server if not available in the internal database.
  - Checking serial numbers on EveryMac.

- **Build Requirements:**
  - [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), targeting .NET Framework 4.8.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure your system has [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) installed.
2. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/MuertoGB/MacEfiToolkit/releases/latest) of **mefit**.
3. If needed, create a dump of your Mac firmware using an SPIROM programmer.
4. Launch the software (**no installation required**) and open your firmware.

## Application Manual

> ðŸ“‹ View the application manual [here](MANUAL.md#application-manual).

## Wine Instructions

To run **Mac EFI Toolkit** on Linux or macOS using Wine, follow these steps:

1. **Install [Wine](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/home)** to your Operating System.
2. Open the terminal and run the command `winecfg`. This will open the Wine configuration window. Then, navigate to the **'Graphics'** tab and change the **'Screen resolution'** to **120 dpi**.
3. Download the font pack archive from [here](stream/fonts). After downloading, navigate to `Home\.wine\drive_c\windows\Fonts`. Extract the downloaded font pack archive and copy the fonts into this folder.

Once these steps are completed, you should be able to run **Mac EFI Toolkit** under Wine.
